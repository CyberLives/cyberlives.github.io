Ekida is destroying this city. Six months ago they bought out the local mayor… Again. In turn they ravaged the state with insane building contracts, reckless stirpping of natural recourses and, of course, the legalization of “private security teams armed to be capable of defending against likely or perceived threats against technological industry”. In other words, Ekida has a battalion of well equipped mercenaries sitting in the city center, patrolling the streets while local police forces fuck around roughing up the poor and ignoring the machine gun wielding guns-fire-hire walking through the street.

Something needs to be done about Ekida. There are rumours about something bigger going on in their R&D, but I'll have to get Violet on that.
