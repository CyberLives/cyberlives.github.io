There’s huge volumes data connections being funnelled through the security systems at Ekida. it’s all hands on deck to get it up and running but no one has any idea what it’s for. All we do know is that it has to meet extremely specific specifications and that the data flow is so high we could pump half the internet through there every second. It is actually ridiculous to think of the volume of money that went into the construction. Half the city is getting ripped up for new cables and just about every wireless system in the state is being modified in one way or another. It’s under the guise of a new, ultra speed, Eko Network for Ekida contract holders. I don’t buy it for a second. A few of the guys in the office have raised questions but just can’t be bothered taking it another step. It’ll definitely peek Roland’s interest, whatever it is.
